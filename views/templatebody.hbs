      <h3>VIEWS</h3>
      <p>View are what is loaded into the body of the page. The view templates:
        details, setmain and templatebody should not be touched. They can be,
        but not recommended unless you want to change the design. If it's a
        useful change, please let me know.</p>
      <p>
        The view templates: details, setmain and templatebody will also get
        overwritten doing a git pull. So if you use pm2 and my scripts to auto
        grab the lastest changes on a reboot, you could lose your edit.</p>
      <p>if working from filesystem, rename_to_main.hbs is used as a start for
        your sensors. The reason for not calling it main.hbs is so that when you
        create your own main.hbs and go to git pull my updates, it will not
        overwrite your changes.</p>
      <p>Basically on first run, open rename_to_main.hbs and copy the contents.
        Then next to 'create file=>', type in main.hbs, press enter, and paste
        in the contents. Change the details for your own sensors. Save the
        changes.</p>

      <h3>TEMPLATES</h3>
      <p>Templates are what is loaded into the view in realitime as sensor data
        comes in. These should be named based on the groups you setup.</p>

      <h3>Editor</h3>
      <p>This is a pretty basic wyswyg editor. I grabbed the smallest that would
        allow text editing.</p>
      <p>I added a few quick macros to the Action bar. All are used in my
        example test.hbs file. These are created by using
        handlebars.registerHelper.
        <ul>
          <li>FE - For each loop</li>
          <li>DJ - Dayjs formatting example</li>
          <li>IF - If statement.</li>
          <li>FX - convert string to float with X decimal places shown.</li>
          <li>CL - CLEAR EDITS.</li>
        </ul>
